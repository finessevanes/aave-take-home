### QA
#### ‚ùì How can I get a list of the recent liquidations on the Aave Polygon V3 market?
I wasn't able to confirm this, but I think you might be able to use GraphQL, since that is the tool used to get user account information to determine whealth of the loan. I researched polyscan to see if they had an api endpoint, they do not. Using the Pool Contract for Polygon (0x794a61358D6845594F94dc1DB02A252b5b4814aD) I searched in polygoscan for `liquidationCall` but couldn't find it in the first 500 transactions listed.
#### ‚ùì How do I get my token listed on Aave?
__‚úÖ A:__ In order to have your token added to the Aave ecosystem, you will need to complete the following tasks:

__1. Complete Off-Chain Process__:

- üî∏ Begin the ARC (Aave Request for Comments) process by submitting a post on the [Governance Forum](https://governance.aave.com/)

- üî∏ Upon rough community consensus, create an [AIP](https://docs.aave.com/governance/aips) (Aave Improvement Proposal)

- üî∏ Provide Chainlink price feed

*For a description of the above tasks, please read [New Asset Listing](https://docs.aave.com/governance/guides/new-asset-listing)*

__2. Prepare On-Chain Process__

- üî∏ Create a pull request
run the asset deployment script

*For a description of the above tasks, please read [Prepare for the on-chain process](https://docs.aave.com/developers/v/2.0/protocol-governance/governance/propose-your-token-as-new-aave-asset#2.-prepare-for-the-on-chain-process).*

__3. Make a proposal__

Get your [AIP IPFS hash](https://github.com/aave/aip/blob/master/content/ipfs-aips/all-aips.json). 
Go through the steps listed in the [Asset Listing Repository](https://github.com/aave/aave-asset-listing]) and then deploy the on-chain proposal.

__4. Follow up__

Connect with Aave Genesis on [Discord](https://aave.com/discord) or [Telegram](https://t.me/Aavesome).


#### ‚ùì How often do token prices update and based upon which price service?
__‚úÖ A:__ Aave uses the Chainlink Aggregator are a price oracle. Chainlink nodes update under two conditions (parameters):

__Deviation of Parameter__
Off-chain, Chainlink nodes are watching token prices. 
Generally speaking, if the token's price changes more than .05% in a given time frame, the nodes will be set off and will prices will be updated.

__Time Interval__
If the price changes are under the deviation as stated from above, then it will set off an update every X minutes over the course of an hour.

Aave also has their own backup price oracle incase Chainlink breaks.
#### ‚ùì I‚Äôm interested in building a liquidation bot, what do I need to get started on this?
__‚úÖ A:__ To get started, you want to consider the following four things:

1. Check the balance of your bot. You need funds in order to liquidate.

2. Check your profits. Gas isn't free

3. Keep current protool user data

4. Write tests and keep security top of mind
